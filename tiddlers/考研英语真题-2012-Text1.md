That whispered message, half invitation and half forcing, is what most of us think of when we hear the words peer pressure.   

> pressure 压力  
> whispered 耳语

But in her new book Join the Club, Tin contends that peer pressure can also be a positive force through what she calls the social cure, in which organizations and officials use the power of group dynamics to help individuals improve their lives and possibly the world.   
当听到“同侪压力”这个词时，我们大多数人都会想到这句半邀请、半强迫的耳语。同侪压力通常会导致不良的结果酗酒、吸毒和滥交。但是，蒂娜·罗森伯格在其新作《加入俱乐部》中声称，同侪压力也可以通过她所谓的社会治疗成为一种积极的力量；在社会治疗中，机构和官员们利用群体互动的力量帮助个人改善生活，甚至可能改善世界。  

Rosenberg, the recipient of a Prize, offers a host of example of the social cure in action: In South Carolina, a state-sponsored antismoking program called Rage Against the Haze sets out to make cigarettes uncool.
In South Africa, an HIV-prevention initiative known as LoveLife recruits young people to promote safe sex among their peers.    
普利策奖得主罗森伯格列举了很多正在进行中的社会治疗案例：在南卡罗来纳州，一场由州政府资助的名为“怒对烟雾”的反吸烟活动旨在让吸烟变成不酷的行为。在南非，一项名为“热爱生命”的预防艾滋病的倡议活动招募年轻人在其同龄人中宣传安全性行为。  

Her critique of the lameness of many pubic-health campaigns is spot-on: they fail to mobilize peer pressure for healthy habits, and they demonstrate a seriously flawed understanding of psychology.  
"Dare to be different, please don't smoke!" pleads one billboard campaign aimed at reducing smoking among teenagers-teenagers, who desire nothing more than fitting in.  
她对许多公共健康运动缺陷的评论一针见血：它们没能调动同侪压力以促成健康的生活习惯，而且展示出对心理学严重的理解偏差。一项旨在减少青少年吸烟的广告牌宣传运动倡议：“敢于与众不同，请勿吸烟！” —— 但青少年最渴望的恰恰是融入群体。  

Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure.  
Join the Club is filled with too much irrelevant detail and not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful.  
罗森伯格指出，公共使康侣子者应该向热练运用同侪压力的广告人学习，这一观点很有说服力。《加入俱乐部》一书中充斥着太多无关的细节，而且没有充分探究使同侪压力变得如此强大的社会和生物因素。  

The most glaring flaw of the social cure as it's presented here is that it doesn't work very well for very long.  
An emerging body of research shows that positive health habits - as well as negative ones - spread through networks of friends via social communication.  
如书中所述，社会治疗最明显的缺陷是它不能持久地发挥良好的作用。不断涌现的大量研究表明，积极的健康习惯和消极的健康习惯一样，都会通过社交在朋友圈中传播。
